## Overview
Customer churn prediction is a vital component of customer relationship management for businesses across various sectors. It entails the application of machine learning and data analysis techniques to forecast which customers are likely to discontinue their engagement with a product or service. By leveraging historical customer data, including factors such as demographics, behavior, and usage patterns, companies can proactively identify and target at-risk customers. This enables them to implement retention strategies, reducing revenue loss and fostering customer loyalty.

The process typically involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the development of predictive models. These models, often based on algorithms like logistic regression or decision trees, assign a probability score to each customer, indicating their likelihood of churning. Businesses can then prioritize their efforts on high-risk customers, tailoring personalized offers, incentives, or interventions to mitigate churn. Customer churn prediction not only preserves revenue streams but also enhances customer satisfaction by addressing issues before they lead to attrition, ultimately boosting long-term profitability and competitiveness.

This repository provides a comprehensive solution for customer churn prediction using machine learning techniques. We have included a dataset for training and testing the model, along with an IPython notebook (customer_churn_prediction.ipynb) that guides you through the entire process.

## Dataset
We have included the dataset required for this project in the repository. You can also access it on Kaggle using the following link:
* **Telco Customer Churn Dataset:** [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

The dataset includes relevant features such as customer demographics, transaction history, and churn status.
